# ABI Coder

A set of high-level ABI encoding and decoding utils.

## Motivation

There are several packages that provide ABI coding utils. However, there is no a high-level solution in the Ethers ecosystem. `web3-eth-abi` and `abi-decoder` depend on web3.js. `@ethersproject/abi` is pretty low-level. `ethereumjs-abi` works only with functions. Many other packages provide encoding or decoding only.

## Features

* Function coding
* Event coding
* Constructor coding
* TS support

## Installation

`npm install abi-coder`

## Example

```ts
```

## API

```ts
```
